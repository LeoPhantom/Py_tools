Basic XSS Scanner in Python
This repository contains a simple Python tool designed to perform basic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability scanning on web applications. It works by injecting common XSS payloads into URL parameters and checking if these payloads are reflected in the server's response.

Disclaimer: This tool is for educational purposes and basic testing only. Always obtain explicit permission before scanning any website. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.

Features
URL Parameter Injection: Injects a predefined set of XSS payloads into existing GET request parameters of a target URL.

Reflection Detection: Checks if the injected payload string is directly reflected in the HTTP response body, indicating a potential vulnerability.

Basic Payloads: Includes a small set of common XSS payloads for testing.

Console Output: Provides real-time feedback on the scanning process and a summary of potential vulnerabilities found.

How it Works (Simplified)
Payloads: The scanner uses a list of known XSS attack strings (e.g., <script>alert('XSS');</script>).

URL Parsing: It takes a target URL, identifies its existing parameters (like ?param=value), and then creates new test URLs.

Injection: For each parameter, it replaces the original value with an XSS payload.

Request & Check: It sends an HTTP GET request to the new test URL. If the exact XSS payload is found within the website's response, it flags a potential XSS vulnerability.

Limitations
This is a basic scanner and has several limitations:

GET Parameters Only: It only tests injection into URL (GET) parameters. It does not test POST requests, HTTP headers, cookies, or other input vectors.

Simple Reflection: It only checks for direct reflection of the payload string. It does not account for complex encoding, partial reflections, or client-side DOM manipulation.

No Browser Emulation: It does not actually execute JavaScript in a browser environment, so it cannot confirm if the XSS would truly trigger in a user's browser.

Limited Payloads: The included XSS_PAYLOADS list is small. Real-world XSS attacks and professional scanners use much more extensive and sophisticated payloads.

False Positives/Negatives: Due to its simplicity, it may produce false positives (flagging non-vulnerabilities) or miss actual, more complex vulnerabilities.

Setup and Installation
Save the Code:
Save the Python code from the Canvas as xss_scanner.py.

Install Dependencies:
This tool requires the requests library. If you don't have it installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

pip install requests

How to Run the Scanner
Open Your Terminal:
Navigate to the directory where you saved xss_scanner.py.

Modify Target URL (Crucial Step):
Before running, edit the xss_scanner.py file and locate the if __name__ == "__main__": block.
Change the target_url_1, target_url_2, or target_url_3 variables to the URL of the website you wish to scan.

Example:

# Example 1: A URL with an existing parameter (replace with your target)
target_url_1 = "http://your-target-website.com/somepage.php?id=123"
scan_xss(target_url_1)

Remember: Only scan websites you have explicit permission to test. Using this tool on unauthorized websites is illegal and unethical.

Execute the Scanner:
Run the script from your terminal:

python xss_scanner.py

The scanner will print its progress and any potential XSS vulnerabilities it finds directly to your console.
